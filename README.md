# unalgar-timeline

Unalgar Timeline is a 4-weeks project we made with 4 other students from the Lyon's Wild Code School. It is an online game based on the boardgame "Timeline". The goal is to sort movies in a timeline, depending on their release dates.

We developed Unalgar Timeline using HTML/CSS and Typescript, using Angular framework to build it as a single page application. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.

We use [the Movie database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to provide the top rated movies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
